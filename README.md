üîπ PHASE 1 ‚Äî Introduction (5 mins)
Q1: Tell me about one project where you owned end-to-end delivery using AWS and Go.

Expected Answer: Should highlight complete ownership ‚Äî from architecture to deployment ‚Äî using AWS services like Lambda, ECS, or EC2, and Go for backend logic. Should mention CI/CD, monitoring, and cost optimization. A good candidate emphasizes design decisions, trade-offs, and outcomes (e.g., performance gains, cost savings).

Follow-up:

‚ÄúWhat would you do differently now?‚Äù ‚Üí Looks for introspection and evolution in design choices.

‚ÄúWhich part only you understood deeply?‚Äù ‚Üí Tests unique expertise and ownership instincts.

üîπ PHASE 2 ‚Äî AWS + Go Fundamentals (10 mins)
Q2: Design a scalable API using AWS components.

Expected Answer: Should mention Load Balancer (ALB), API Gateway, Lambda/ECS (Go runtime), RDS/DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch. Mentions security layers (IAM, VPC, SGs).
Good engineers mention autoscaling, fault tolerance, and CI/CD deployment with CodePipeline or Terraform.

Follow-ups:

Use IAM roles, VPCs, or PrivateLink for secure service comms.

Region-level resilience through multi-region failover or Route53.

Lambda timeout debugging using CloudWatch logs and X-Ray.

Q3: Explain goroutines and channels in Go.

Expected Answer: Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by Go runtime; channels synchronize and share data safely. The candidate should mention avoiding global state and using select for multiplexing.

Follow-ups:

[]rune for Unicode correctness.

-race flag for detecting race conditions.

Awareness of goroutine leaks and context cancellations.

üîπ PHASE 3 ‚Äî Scenario-Based System Design (15 mins)
Q4: Design a logging pipeline for multiple microservices (AWS + Go).

Expected Answer: Use Kinesis Firehose or Kafka ‚Üí Lambda (Go) ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Glue/Athena for queries. Add CloudWatch logs for monitoring and IAM for permissions.
Mentions schema evolution or partitioning in S3 for efficient querying.

Follow-ups:

Handle out-of-order logs with timestamp sorting.

Avoid duplicates via deduplication key or DynamoDB state.

Scalability test using load simulation or AWS FIS.

Multi-region via cross-region replication in S3.

Q5: Structuring a Go project using AWS SDKs.

Expected Answer: Use clean architecture: cmd/, pkg/, internal/.
Maintain AWS sessions centrally; dependency inject clients. Mock AWS SDK with interfaces for tests.

Follow-ups:

Manage session reuse to prevent overhead.

Use gomock or testify for mocking SDKs.

üîπ PHASE 4 ‚Äî Debugging & Problem Solving (15 mins)
Q6: ECS Fargate service shows high latency ‚Äî how to debug?

Expected Answer: Start with CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, network). Check container logs, analyze X-Ray traces, and verify DB latency.
Check connection pooling, goroutine blocking, or DNS resolution delay.

Follow-ups:

Differentiate network vs code issues via VPC Flow Logs or profiling.

Time-specific issues hint at autoscaling or DB throttling.

Q7: S3 costs suddenly doubled ‚Äî what‚Äôs your plan?

Expected Answer: Check AWS Cost Explorer, S3 Storage Lens, and CloudTrail for changes.
Investigate versioning or unexpired lifecycle policies. Enable intelligent tiering.

Follow-ups:

Automate cost enforcement using IaC and lifecycle policies.

Use AWS Config for detecting public buckets.

Q8: Deploy & roll back a Go microservice via CI/CD.

Expected Answer: Use CodePipeline + CodeDeploy (blue/green). Terraform for infra.
Maintain versioned artifacts in S3 or ECR. Implement rollback through version tags.

Follow-ups:

Handle DB schema migrations with pre/post deploy steps.

Rollback failure = resource conflict ‚Üí automate cleanup.

üîπ PHASE 5 ‚Äî Leadership & Ownership (10 mins)
Q9: You lead 4 engineers ‚Äî how do you start from scratch?

Expected Answer: Establish coding standards, Git branching, sprint rituals, CI/CD pipelines, and lightweight documentation. Prioritize backlog, define MVP, and ensure local setup works for all.

Follow-ups:

First week = repo setup, pipeline, code review rules.

Handling underperformers = mentorship + pairing + clear goals.

Teaching juniors: review-based learning and pair debugging.

Q10: PM changes requirements mid-sprint ‚Äî what‚Äôs your move?

Expected Answer: Reassess impact, communicate clearly to team and PM, adjust sprint scope if needed.
Maintains delivery while protecting morale.

Follow-ups:

Balance delivery vs flexibility.

Propose feature flags to decouple delivery from requirements.

üîπ PHASE 6 ‚Äî Wrap-Up (5 mins)
Q11: What‚Äôs one AWS or Go concept you learned recently?

Expected Answer: Should mention something advanced like Lambda SnapStart, Step Functions, Go generics, or context propagation.

Follow-ups:

How do you help your team stay updated?

Mention of internal knowledge-sharing is a plus.

‚öôÔ∏è CODING QUESTIONS (For Notepad)

You can ask 2‚Äì3 of these in the middle (Phases 3‚Äì4).

1. Reverse a string
func Reverse(s string) string {
    r := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
    }
    return string(r)
}


‚úÖ Should handle Unicode properly.

Follow-up: Why rune instead of byte?

2. Safe counter
type Counter struct {
    mu sync.Mutex
    val int
}

func (c *Counter) Inc() { c.mu.Lock(); c.val++; c.mu.Unlock() }
func (c *Counter) Dec() { c.mu.Lock(); c.val--; c.mu.Unlock() }
func (c *Counter) Value() int { c.mu.Lock(); defer c.mu.Unlock(); return c.val }


‚úÖ Tests thread safety understanding.

Follow-up: When use sync/atomic instead?

3. Worker pool
func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    for j := range jobs {
        results <- j * 2
    }
}


‚úÖ Expect proper use of goroutines, channels, and WaitGroups.

Follow-up:

How to stop workers on error?

What if jobs channel closes early?

4. Retry with exponential backoff
func Retry(operation func() error, attempts int) error {
    delay := time.Second
    for i := 0; i < attempts; i++ {
        err := operation()
        if err == nil { return nil }
        time.Sleep(delay)
        delay *= 2
    }
    return fmt.Errorf("failed after %d retries", attempts)
}


‚úÖ Tests error handling & timing logic.

Follow-up: Add context cancellation or jitter.

5. JSON Manipulation
var obj map[string]interface{}
json.Unmarshal([]byte(`{"name":"John","age":30}`), &obj)
obj["role"] = "Senior Engineer"
data, _ := json.Marshal(obj)
fmt.Println(string(data))


‚úÖ Tests struct vs map usage and dynamic JSON handling.
