üîπ PHASE 1 ‚Äî Introduction (5 mins)



Q1: Tell me about one project where you owned end-to-end delivery using AWS and Go.

Expected Answer: Should highlight complete ownership ‚Äî from architecture to deployment ‚Äî using AWS services like Lambda, ECS, or EC2, and Go for backend logic. Should mention CI/CD, monitoring, and cost optimization. A good candidate emphasizes design decisions, trade-offs, and outcomes (e.g., performance gains, cost savings).

Follow-up:

‚ÄúWhat would you do differently now?‚Äù ‚Üí Looks for introspection and evolution in design choices.

‚ÄúWhich part only you understood deeply?‚Äù ‚Üí Tests unique expertise and ownership instincts.


üîπ PHASE 2 ‚Äî AWS + Go Fundamentals (10 mins)


Q2: Design a scalable API using AWS components.

Expected Answer: Should mention Load Balancer (ALB), API Gateway, Lambda/ECS (Go runtime), RDS/DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch. Mentions security layers (IAM, VPC, SGs).
Good engineers mention autoscaling, fault tolerance, and CI/CD deployment with CodePipeline or Terraform.

Follow-ups:

Use IAM roles, VPCs, or PrivateLink for secure service comms.

Region-level resilience through multi-region failover or Route53.

Lambda timeout debugging using CloudWatch logs and X-Ray.




Q3: Explain goroutines and channels in Go.

Expected Answer: Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by Go runtime; channels synchronize and share data safely. The candidate should mention avoiding global state and using select for multiplexing.

Follow-ups:

[]rune for Unicode correctness.

-race flag for detecting race conditions.

Awareness of goroutine leaks and context cancellations.





üîπ PHASE 3 ‚Äî Scenario-Based System Design (15 mins)

Q4: Design a logging pipeline for multiple microservices (AWS + Go).

Expected Answer: Use Kinesis Firehose or Kafka ‚Üí Lambda (Go) ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Glue/Athena for queries. Add CloudWatch logs for monitoring and IAM for permissions.
Mentions schema evolution or partitioning in S3 for efficient querying.

Follow-ups:

Handle out-of-order logs with timestamp sorting.

Avoid duplicates via deduplication key or DynamoDB state.

Scalability test using load simulation or AWS FIS.

Multi-region via cross-region replication in S3.




Q5: Structuring a Go project using AWS SDKs.

Expected Answer: Use clean architecture: cmd/, pkg/, internal/.
Maintain AWS sessions centrally; dependency inject clients. Mock AWS SDK with interfaces for tests.

Follow-ups:

Manage session reuse to prevent overhead.

Use gomock or testify for mocking SDKs.



üîπ PHASE 4 ‚Äî Debugging & Problem Solving (15 mins)


Q6: ECS Fargate service shows high latency ‚Äî how to debug?

Expected Answer: Start with CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, network). Check container logs, analyze X-Ray traces, and verify DB latency.
Check connection pooling, goroutine blocking, or DNS resolution delay.

Follow-ups:

Differentiate network vs code issues via VPC Flow Logs or profiling.

Time-specific issues hint at autoscaling or DB throttling.




Q7: S3 costs suddenly doubled ‚Äî what‚Äôs your plan?

Expected Answer: Check AWS Cost Explorer, S3 Storage Lens, and CloudTrail for changes.
Investigate versioning or unexpired lifecycle policies. Enable intelligent tiering.

Follow-ups:

Automate cost enforcement using IaC and lifecycle policies.

Use AWS Config for detecting public buckets.




Q8: Deploy & roll back a Go microservice via CI/CD.

Expected Answer: Use CodePipeline + CodeDeploy (blue/green). Terraform for infra.
Maintain versioned artifacts in S3 or ECR. Implement rollback through version tags.

Follow-ups:

Handle DB schema migrations with pre/post deploy steps.

Rollback failure = resource conflict ‚Üí automate cleanup.



üîπ PHASE 5 ‚Äî Leadership & Ownership (10 mins)



Q9: You lead 4 engineers ‚Äî how do you start from scratch?

Expected Answer: Establish coding standards, Git branching, sprint rituals, CI/CD pipelines, and lightweight documentation. Prioritize backlog, define MVP, and ensure local setup works for all.

Follow-ups:

First week = repo setup, pipeline, code review rules.

Handling underperformers = mentorship + pairing + clear goals.

Teaching juniors: review-based learning and pair debugging.




Q10: PM changes requirements mid-sprint ‚Äî what‚Äôs your move?

Expected Answer: Reassess impact, communicate clearly to team and PM, adjust sprint scope if needed.
Maintains delivery while protecting morale.

Follow-ups:

Balance delivery vs flexibility.

Propose feature flags to decouple delivery from requirements.



üîπ PHASE 6 ‚Äî Wrap-Up (5 mins)


Q11: What‚Äôs one AWS or Go concept you learned recently?

Expected Answer: Should mention something advanced like Lambda SnapStart, Step Functions, Go generics, or context propagation.

Follow-ups:

How do you help your team stay updated?

Mention of internal knowledge-sharing is a plus.

‚öôÔ∏è CODING QUESTIONS (For Notepad)

You can ask 2‚Äì3 of these in the middle (Phases 3‚Äì4).

1. Reverse a string
```go
func Reverse(s string) string {
    r := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
    }
    return string(r)
}
```


‚úÖ Should handle Unicode properly.

Follow-up: Why rune instead of byte?

2. Write a Go function that counts occurrences of each word in a given sentence.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

// CountWordOccurrences counts the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.
// It returns a map where keys are the words and values are their respective counts.
func CountWordOccurrences(sentence string) map[string]int {
	// Convert the sentence to lowercase to treat "The" and "the" as the same word.
	lowerSentence := strings.ToLower(sentence)

	// Split the sentence into words using whitespace as a delimiter.
	// strings.Fields handles multiple spaces and trims leading/trailing spaces.
	words := strings.Fields(lowerSentence)

	// Create a map to store word counts.
	wordCounts := make(map[string]int)

	// Iterate over the words and increment their counts in the map.
	for _, word := range words {
		wordCounts[word]++
	}

	return wordCounts
}

func main() {
	sentence := "Go is a great language. Go is fun to learn."
	counts := CountWordOccurrences(sentence)

	fmt.Println("Word occurrences:")
	for word, count := range counts {
		fmt.Printf("'%s': %d\n", word, count)
	}

	sentence2 := "Hello world, hello Go!"
	counts2 := CountWordOccurrences(sentence2)

	fmt.Println("\nWord occurrences for second sentence:")
	for word, count := range counts2 {
		fmt.Printf("'%s': %d\n", word, count)
	}
}
```

Follow-up: When use sync/atomic instead?




simple coding

1. Variable Shadowing

Question:
What is the output of the following snippet?

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10
    if true {
        x := 20
        fmt.Println(x)
    }
    fmt.Println(x)
}
```

Expected Answer:

20
10


Explanation:
The inner x := 20 declares a new variable shadowing the outer one ‚Äî scope ends with the block.

Follow-up:

What happens if you use x = 20 instead of x := 20?

2. Nil Interface Trick

Question:
What is the output?

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x *int = nil
    var i interface{} = x
    if i == nil {
        fmt.Println("nil interface")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("non-nil interface")
    }
}
```

Expected Answer:

non-nil interface


Explanation:
The interface i holds a typed nil (*int(nil)), which means the interface itself isn‚Äôt nil ‚Äî both type and value must be nil for the interface to be nil.

Follow-up:

How can you check if the underlying value of an interface is nil?

3. Slice Backing Array Trap

Question:
What will be printed here?

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    s := []int{1, 2, 3}
    t := s
    t[0] = 100
    fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Expected Answer:

[100 2 3]


Explanation:
Slices share the same backing array; modifying one changes all references.

Follow-up:

How can you make a true copy so s isn‚Äôt affected?

4. Deferred Function Execution

Question:
Predict the output:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        defer fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

Expected Answer:

2
1
0


Explanation:
Deferred functions execute in LIFO order after main() returns.
